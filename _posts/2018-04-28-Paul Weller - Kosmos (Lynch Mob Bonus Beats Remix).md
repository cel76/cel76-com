I first heard this Paul Weller remix on the Future Sound of London’s legendary December 1993 Essential Mix on BBC Radio 1. FSOL broadcasted live from their Earthbeat studio via ISDN into the BBC Studios. Their combination of sound, visuals and technology were cutting edge and incredibly exciting at the time. If you haven’t heard it, you can hear the entire broadcast on [MixCloud](https://www.mixcloud.com/DJ_Mix/future-sound-of-london-fsol-essential-mix-1993-12-04/).
To me it’s timeless. The track was remixed by Paul Weller’s long time producer Brendan Lynch, known for his experimental dub remixes as a side hobby to his regular pop/rock productions. With the internet in it’s infancy (Netscape didn’t even exist until 1994), tracklist information was hard to come by in those days. I only discovered the record by chance at a free party in a field at dawn in the middle of nowhere in Somerset, played out by some hippie funk acquaintances who ran nights called ‘The Dig In’ on a [boat](http://www.theklabristol.co.uk) in Bristol. Fun times.
