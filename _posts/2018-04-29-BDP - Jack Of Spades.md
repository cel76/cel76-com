BDP’s 4th album ‘Edutainment’ was the 2nd album I ever purchased after being handed a crappy cassette recording of ‘Ghetto Music: The Blueprint of Hip Hop’ when I was 13/14 years old. I was drawn to the raw minimal production values, funk samples, jamaican musical influences, beatboxing, and to an extent for a 13 year old the outspoken, defiant, socially conscious lyrics. 
Written and produced by BDPs only constant member KRS-One, ‘Jack of Spades’ is about a vigilante trying to clean up his neighbourhood whilst paid-off police look on. It uses a sample from Jamaican funk band Brentford Allstars’ dub cover of James Brown’s ‘Get on the Good Foot’, ‘Greedy G’. It was included on the soundtrack to the 1988 blaxploitation parody ‘I’m Gonna Git You Sucka’ and the music video contains clips from said film. It went to number 3 in the US Rap charts in ’88 but more importantly appeared on that crappy cassette recording I was handed in 1990.
