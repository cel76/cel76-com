As a young teenager in the mid to late Eighties I was a big fan of the Pet Shop Boys. I was drawn to their fusion of Hi-NRG and electro influences with strong melodies. I admired their refusal to conform to the standard pop act format and the resoluteness of their principals. Their reluctance to perform on stage or be interviewed created a certain mysticism and intrigue. Throughout the decade they consistently had remixes of their music produced by unknown artists such as Arthur Baker, Junior Vasquez, Francois Kervorkian, Tyree, Marshall Jefferson, Sterling Void as well as Brothers in Rhythm and KLF which ultimately led me to the discovery of a whole new underground music scene I never knew existed. Two Divided By Zero is the opening track on their first album entitled ‘Please’. It has their early trademark electro drums, synth basslines and features a talking calculator.
